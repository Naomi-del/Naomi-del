# Hello there , I am Naomi Anih. 

I am a newly qualified data analyst based in Nigeria. 

I have a strong background in copywriting, which was my job for 4+ years. 

I’m interested in analysis and prediction related to product analytics and user experiences. 

The tools I primarily use are SQL, Power BI, and Excel. 

I’m looking to collaborate on any beginner-level tasks related to data analysis.
